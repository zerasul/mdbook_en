# 16 Bits Homebrew Development

## Foreword and Acknowledgments

For many, it's been a long road since we turned on the CRT television, tuned in to UHF channel 36, and turned on a screen that said «SEEGAAA». Everything changed at that moment; when we began to see a certain porcupine hopping and cartwheeling at full speed.

This book is dedicated to all of us who grew up with a 3-button controller in our hands and who have continued to dream of being the ones to create our own games.

Many of us have since moved on down the technology path; especially those of us I affectionately call the _"Tech-inquiring"_; as like me that we have learned to use technology and how to create it.

I want to thank all of you who have supported me to make this book and to continue giving talks and workshops about it.

## Special Acknowledgments

Of course, I have not forgotten those who have always supported me.

I want to dedicate this book to the association La Jaquería, whose effort to keep doing things in Almería is getting stronger every day. Also a special mention to the retro development club that has helped me to write this book; without forgetting the Durango Computer team (Emilio and Carlos).

I would also like to thank my dear friends from the Canary Islands, Jesús and Yurena, who are always on my mind and I hope they enjoy this book, which is mainly for them.

I can't forget, of course, my WoW (now from Microsoft) people, such as Laikhas, Sharedia, Corvec and Hydrargiros; besides the people of the _Leyendas del Olvidado_ guild. They have always had to put up with me so many years later.

Without forgetting my family that has given me so much and now I am the one who wants to return the favor. Not forgetting the one who gave me my first Mega Drive and the one who I think was the reason why I followed the path of technology; my cousin Jose Luis Egea "Tronko".

Finally thank the _Mega Drive development_ group of Telegram; they have taught me a lot; besides encouraging me to continue advancing in this little world of homebrew; I hope they like it and help in their projects.
